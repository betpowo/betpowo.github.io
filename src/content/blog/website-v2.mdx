import CharButton from '../../components/CharButton.astro'

things were due for a change. the original layout looked so wonky and was rlly unoptimized.
the new layout is stil those things but less... i hope

anyways, lo and behold:
## website v2.0.0 !!!!!!!! 🎈🎉🎉🎉✨🎇
i've been working nonstop on this new website ever since uhm... september 2025 i believe?
it's been so long i forgot when i actually started... maybe it was that

# changes
all of the pages. all of them...

...mostly the [characters](/characters/) page. i LOVE how it turned out.. :>

stuff now (supposedly) transitions smoothly thanks to the awesome library: [*astro-spa* by RafidMuhymin](https://github.com/RafidMuhymin/astro-spa)!!!
shoutouts to them for letting me do what i always wanted with the website: avoid full page reloads cus they fucking suck
and do not feel great
<p style="font-size: 0.6em;">(you can turn it off in [index → settings](/) if it either runs like shit or doesn't work (should be automatically off on old phones that don't support astro-spa))</p>

it should run fine on most devices, i actually tweak the css a bit on specific screen sizes so
mobile devices shouldn't suffer with an inconsistent layout anymore! :D

don't forget to share this website with as many as you can (don't), and if you wanna link it
inside your OWN website, i recommend using the stamp code in [index → about](/)! please do i'm lonely

<div style="display: flex; font-size: 18px; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
i'm not gonna waste the opportunity. <CharButton size="50" /><CharButton size="50" /><CharButton size="50" /> draw me draw all of my characters  /j/jj/jjjj/j/jj/j//j//jj/j
</div>
