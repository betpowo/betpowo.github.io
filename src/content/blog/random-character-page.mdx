import CharButton from '../../components/CharButton.astro'

finally, a truly small update

there's nothing much to say here, i just added a "random" page for the characters section

---

### how to get to it if you can't read the room
on the [characters](/characters/) page, on the id input, type `random` for well, a random character

or if you're lazy click this button (only in this blog post):

<div style="width: fit-content; margin: auto; text-align: center;">
    <div style="width: fit-content; margin: auto;">
        <CharButton character="random" />
    </div>
    the `?` will only ever appear if the `art.svg` isn't found.<br/>
    since this will never happen normally i decided to showcase it here
</div>
