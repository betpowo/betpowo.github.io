She has rose brown fluffy hair, bright blue eyes with weird letters in them, and somewhat pink skin, but that may be because of my art style.
She wears a hot pink... uhh... hoodie??? It doesn't have any pockets though, so I don't know; and also black shorts (not black in my style due to the limited palette rule) with one white stripe with shoes to match; kinda cute.

No, she's never gonna wear brown contacts.

- The symbols in her eyes will light up when in an "overwhelmed" state, like being nervous or scared, not exactly when actually overwhelmed tho.
- She runs a *teeny tiny* bit faster than the average human. She can also jump a bit higher. Don't blame me, blame [Geometry Dash](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/).

- She's a bit shy, and doesn't talk much; doesn't mean she doesn't like you though.
- She got her eye symbols from ██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████ (will be explained in the future)
