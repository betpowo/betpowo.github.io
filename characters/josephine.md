- The symbols in her eyes will light up when in an "overwhelmed" state, like being nervous or scared, not exactly when actually overwhelmed tho.
- She runs a *teeny tiny* bit faster than the average human. She can also jump a bit higher. Don't blame me, blame [Geometry Dash](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/).
- She's a bit shy, and doesn't talk much; doesn't mean she doesn't like you though.
