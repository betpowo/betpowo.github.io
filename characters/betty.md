**Hey!!!** This one may not really be suitable for younger audiences, this is because of her appearance, which I would like to apologize for, since I wanted her to be as unlikeable as I could. if you can handle it that's fine, just make sure no one is around to judge you for looking at this.

As stated before, she was meant to be unlikeable, that's why she looks so... questionable.
She has black hair with a heart-shaped bit floating above it (this one can break and fix itself), blue eyes and slightly orange skin, I don't know how to describe it.
She wears this... "cold shoulder top" thingy with a cute drawing of a bunny sleeping on it (or is it a dog??? we will never know), some low waisted <span style="color:#0699a2">#0699A2</span> shorts with white strings on them, socks are also white but I didn't want to use pure #FFFFFF for them. If you haven't noticed, I have ditched #000000 and #FFFFFF. Sad, am I right?

No, I'm not gonna wear brown contacts either.

- She doesn't really talk much. She's shy, y'know?
- She can get flustered so easily; like just call her cute once and she's already covering her face in embarrassment. She can't really take compliments that well.
- Can she fit inside your pocket?
