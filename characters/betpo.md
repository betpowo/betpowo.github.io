## Who the hell is this?
**Betpo** is a... somewhat small stick figure friend you can have around that is NOT serious at all (well, only when needed).

He... he's just a stick figure. He also has black shiny hair I guess. Not really notably black since my art style doesn't use pure #000000.

- He does not have gender/sex, he is just a drawing but refers to himself with **he/him** pronouns
- He can quite literally say any meme sound
whenever he wants, he's like a soundboard of some sorts. It makes sense because he comes from ███████████
- He is somewhat elastic, so he can sorta change height or the length of his limbs
- He does not
- As said before, he's not serious/mature most of the time, only when it's necessary
