yes she's made of mostly triangle  .cry about it

she has <span style="color: #9fc">green</span> skin and an
<span style="color: #30c">indigo</span> dress with thigh-highs with the same color... and the tail. right .can't forget the tail

when drawing her keep in mind to make her pointy! i think that's what makes her "sadie" in the first place

btw she's lineless. why? i felt like it. trust me. it's not for an important reason

<span style="color: var(--col-bg)">(at least without spoiling anything)</span>
