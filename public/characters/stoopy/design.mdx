they're pretty much just a chess pawn looking thing, but they're <span style="color: #f8ff8f;">lemon</span> now.
don't ask how <span style="color: #f8ff8f;">lemon</span> is a color  . actually why didnt i just say bright yellow-green instead. fucj

it also has a big swirl on its head. that might be their hair or an exposed nerve. we will never know...

actually wait, what was i talking about? what is this creature? i didnt make this. how did it get here
