she's a robot. cool. but here's the neat part:
when walking/running, she has a chance to never stop, and it becomes a real pickle for her.
she's kinda considered herself "broken" for that

she's embarrassed of this, but at least she has some other people to
count on in this situation, although most of them not being present right now.
