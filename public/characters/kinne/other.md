- this probably wasn't obvious already but, she's meant to be some
sorta video game character! although in a game she would just Never stop running,
random chance would be extremely anoying
    - this whole idea was inspired by a bug i had while changing physics on
    another project i work on, where the player actually didn't stop walking
    when releasing left/right. this applies to her
- her name comes from the word "kinetic", yes it is pronounced like thw word but without the -etic bit
