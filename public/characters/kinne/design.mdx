idk what she's made of. probably metal

she has <span style="color: #6c9;">green</span> ""hair"" with visible welded
plates on it, which also applies to the face kinda

a big springy wire with an arrow-shaped lightbulb on the tip. it lights up when she "walks"
(she has wheels so she rolls instead)

she wears a <span style="color: #ffd16d;">yellow</span> shirt and <span style="
color: #541dc3; filter: drop-shadow(0px 0px 1px #ffc) drop-shadow(0px 0px 1px #ffc) drop-shadow(0px 0px 1px #ffc);
">purple</span> skirt, shirt is real but the skirt isn't. it's solid. i win

she has electifying cables on the back of her, maybe they missed a few spots to cover up...
if touched, both you and her are electrocuted and you die and shit
