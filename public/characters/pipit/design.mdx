she has <span style="color: #5d2d21;">dark brown</span> hair with a pizza pin on it. she likes it

she wears a <span style="color: #ffc; text-shadow: 0px 0px 3px #301, 0px 0px 3px #301;">white</span>
shirt, thigh-highs, and a black skirt, and what looks like slip-on shoes? i think?

let's not forget the iconic <span style="color: #a74c34;">brown</span> vest and glasses she has. they're awesome

it's not the uniform, she just thinks the outfit is rlly nice
