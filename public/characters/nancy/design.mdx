similar to the original **nene**:

she has a <span style="color: #f69;">pink</span> hairband, <span style="color: #f69;">pink</span> shoes,
<span style="color: #f69;">pink</span> apron(?), a
<span style="color: #ffc; text-shadow: 0px 0px 3px #306, 0px 0px 3px #306;">white</span> shirt underneath,
and black pants,

and a weird looking piece of her hair is sticking out. idk why she has that. also she blushes a lot... dude...
she's crazy man idk

<br/>
## extra notes
- i know its already obvious but... she can see! it's just that for stylizing reasons her pupils are gone
- to make up for the lack of pupils, i added a visible nose! ...it looks horrendous.
