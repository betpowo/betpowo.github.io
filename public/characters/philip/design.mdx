similar to the original **pico**:

he's a <span style="color: #ff6e35;">ginger</span> hair, with a <span style="color: #2eaeac;">teal</span> shirt and pants,
<span style="color: #cefa71; text-shadow: 0px 0px 3px #303, 0px 0px 3px #303;">chartreuse</span> vest, and 
<span style="color: #ffffcc; text-shadow: 0px 0px 3px #303, 0px 0px 3px #303;">white</span>
shoes with <span style="color: #ff6e35;">orange</span> soles... with a cool swirly pattern underneath

unlike the rest, his microphone (and his gun) are <span style="color: #b20069;">red</span>

<br/>
## extra notes
- i know its already obvious but... he can see! it's just that for stylizing reasons his pupils are gone
- to make up for the lack of pupils, i added a visible nose! ...it looks horrendous.
