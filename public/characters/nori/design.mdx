she has <span style="color: #cf6;">acid green</span> hair and dress. that's quite all there is to her
<span style="color: #6c9;">(no it isn't)</span>

unlike [glib](/characters/glib/), she actually has a proper skin tone decided: she's <span style="
color: #669; filter: drop-shadow(0px 0px 1px #ffc) drop-shadow(0px 0px 1px #ffc) drop-shadow(0px 0px 1px #ffc);
">gray</span>. <span style="color: #6c9;">(as a human<a class="FUCK" href="#other" x-on:click="tab = 'references'"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, she would actually be <span style="color: #bf6570;
filter: drop-shadow(0px 0px 1px #ffc) drop-shadow(0px 0px 1px #ffc) drop-shadow(0px 0px 1px #ffc);">
black</span>)</span>

she sometimes has visible blush depending on how she's feeling (duh)

## extra notes
- i think the <span style="color: #cf6;">green</span> i chose for her rlly works with "showing her true colors"...
heh.. see what i did there?
- although that phrase isn't exactly the best example for who she is, i just thought
having a brat go through even the Tiniest character development despite not being the main character would be awesome
(i don't know how to write characters (please help (they're after me (oh god please help))))
- as explained with [glib](/characters/glib/), she's tiny for an amazing reason! none at all. trust me
