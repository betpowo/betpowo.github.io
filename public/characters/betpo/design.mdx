he is a stick figure. i'm not writing shit

although you should know his limbs and torso can stretch to comical amounts.
classic stick figure cartoon stuff required for comedy. trust me bro

his hair has these 2 circles coming out of it which looks cooler compared
to his first look he was BALD i'm telling you. well not rlly bald he still had hair
but without these things sticking out so it looked like his circle head
was split in half 😭

he's supposed to be completely black and white. he has an orange tint
because my artstyle doesnt use pure black and white, also cus it looks much nicer
