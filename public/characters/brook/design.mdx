her hair resembles a pinecone. wanna know why?
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
no reason.

she <span style="color: var(--col-main);">(casually)</span> wears leaves.

well, not really obviously they're not actual leaves they just look like them.
she thinks it's comfy and reminds her of her past which... she misses. a lot

idk why she's short but maybe it's cus of where she was born and raised?
i can't tell you right now you'll need to wait for news to come out
