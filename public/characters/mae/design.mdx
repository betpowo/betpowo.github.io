i wanted both a cozy and rude-ish approach with this design, i don't think
i did it right but i love it and i'm proud of it so i'm keeping it

her hair is <span style="color: #e7f7ff; text-shadow: 0px 0px 3px #036, 0px 0px 3px #036;">white</span> and has
dots on it, idk if the're natural, or if it's smth more complex that i don't know about. her skin also has dots
and i know what those are, those are called "freckles" and they'r ebeautiful

she wears <span style="color: #e7f7ff; text-shadow: 0px 0px 3px #036, 0px 0px 3px #036;">white</span> slippers,
a <span style="color: #669;">gray</span> shirt with what's supposed to be merch for uhh... idk what rlly...
and cozy <span style="color: #6cc;">turquoise</span> pants with <span style="color: #e7f7ff; text-shadow: 0px 0px 3px #036, 0px 0px 3px #036;">white</span>
strings. her outfit looks so sleepy people on art fight rlly thought she was like that 😭😭 it's ok though. i love y'all!!! /p

oh yeah, the "ears". this time they aren't real they kinda just. float. but are not her real ears. i hope
