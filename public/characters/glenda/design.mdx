similar to the original **girlfriend**:

she has <span style="color: #63264a;">brown</span> hair, <span style="color: #b20069;">flirt???</span> sweater and heels,
and black shorts.

do you see that note on the right? yea she's typicaly drawn without a mouth cus she doesn't even talk most of the time,
sometimes she tries but just can't. most you could ever get to see her talk is short sentences, she doesn't like talking,
she's nervous she might screw something up
