<style is:inline>{`
.FUCK {
    --col: var(--col-main);
    --col-hover: var(--col-dim);
}
`}</style>

while coming up with her design i was thinking <i style="color: #624;">"i should make her
look like an unlikeable loser girl that has poor sleep schedule and
struggles with social interaction"</i> ... so i tried that . that's why
she looks like that . ok. Ok. fix yo hair gotdam,n

her default fit is just that. the <span style="color: #966;">reddish-brown</span> looking crop top with
the chuddy ass animal on it. i don't even know what it is it looks like
uhhhhh dog ?? bunny ?? cinnamoroll??? pompompurin???? idfk

and the <span style="color: #4d647d;">grayish-blue</span> shorts that are just so so comfy...
yes it has pockets but.. those are in the back.. you'll never see them so
i had to tell you from here .ok . it's better to look at her eyes they're the same color

aaand also <span style="color: #ffc; text-shadow: 0px 0px 3px #301, 0px 0px 3px #301;">white</span> socks.
she's too lazy to use sandals rn. idfk anymore dude

<br/>

## extra notes
- she has a lil fat but whenever she's active she tries to get rid of it. even tho i think it looks better on her. she excersices every once in a while, like me
- she uhhhh also has that thing on top of her hair that looks like a heart<a class="FUCK" href="#other" x-on:click="tab = 'references'"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
- i think she looks better monochrome <span style="color: #966;">(sometimes)</span>
    <br/><img src="/characters/betty/bnw.png" height="200"/>
- **she isn't crying!!!** <span style="color: #966;">(right now)</span> i draw hey eyelashes like that cus theyre barely visible (thanks to the hair) color unless i do this:
    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/characters/betty/eyes.png" height="200"/>
    </div>
    ...but this looks ugly, so
- her hair is supposed to be messy! i just don't know how to draw it... plus it's not THAT messy.....
- zzz..
