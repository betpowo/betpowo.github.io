<span style="color: #93a120;">(for work)</span> she has to wear a <span style="color: #ffc; text-shadow: 0px 0px 2px #93a120, 0px 0px 3px #93a120, 0px 0px 3px #93a120, 0px 0px 3px #93a120;">white</span>
suit, a tie of the <span style="color: #93a120;">"what do you think i'm gonna say"</span> variety, some
<span style="color: #56564a;">dark green</span> pants <span style="color: #93a120;">(just for style reasons, it being green is not required for work)</span>,
and black heels.

apart from the uniform, she has glasses, freckles, and a weird paperclip looking thing at the top.
idk what it is. is it an actual paperclip? or a floating strand of hair? actually if it was hair why is it white-

okay after careful consideration its probably neither of those. probably just a floating hair pin if that's even a thing,
although the green outline and white fill is incorrect. it would probably be her hair color so maybe it is
a very severely styled ahoge or whatever
