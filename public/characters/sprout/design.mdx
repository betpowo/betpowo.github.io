their hair resembles a bush, but actually isn't a bush! that would be very stupid.
the flower is most likely a pin and the vines are probably part of a costume or
they genuinely just forgot to take them off while playing hide and seek. the green hair is natural. don't ask how

they wear a <span style="color: #76149b;">purple</span> shoes and cold shoulder top although a bit oversized so it goes off 1 side,
and <span style="color: #f2ffe7; text-shadow: 0px 0px 3px #301, 0px 0px 3px #301;">white</span> shorts

...and also glasses

lowkey i kinda just went with stuff i like and what seemed like "oc themed around trees or nature" to me
