import ColorButton from '../../../src/components/ColorButton.astro'

she has <span style="color: #90f">purple</span> hair and <span style="color: #f6c">pink</span> dress.

<br/><br/><br/>that's it  . that's literally it

her skin is supposed to be <span style="color: #ffc; text-shadow: 0px 0px 3px #301, 0px 0px 3px #301;">white</span>. but you already
know i hardly ever use white as a color so i guess she's just <span style="color: #ffc; text-shadow: 0px 0px 3px #301, 0px 0px 3px #301;">cheese</span> colored now

<br/>
## extra notes
- i actually like her first apearance's ms-paint color palette ({
['#a349a4', '#ffaec9'].map(
    (a) => <ColorButton color={a} style="display: inline; width: 1em; height: 1em; margin: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 0 1px #fff, 0 0 0 2px #000; border: none; border-radius: 0px; padding: 0;"/>
)
}) better tbh. but my style uses vibrant colors so :(
- why is she so small? reasons i cannot explain. only thing i can say is that she's always been like this
