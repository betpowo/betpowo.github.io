- she was my first proper oc! that's why she gets everything special. i'm sorry other ocs...
- usually i just call her *"josie"* because her real name is too long
    - *"jojo"* is also a valid nickname. but no ne uses it :(
- idk if the theme of "love" is apparent here but it's definitely there. everywhere. her appearance and actions. i hope u can see it cus she loves loving
- you're not gonna believe what her appearance is based off of.

that's right, it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/">geometry dash</a>. <img src="/characters/josephine/fuck.png" width="30" title="josie in square game"/>
    - this also explains her hyperactivity, and also i forgot to mention the fact she's sometimes athletic!!! not all the time though

- of course, her story is gonna have many downs, but that doesn't mean she's gonna be sad all the time! she's fast at recovering... sort of...
