she's got <span style="color: #680e52;">brown</span> hair, <span style="color: #680e52;">brown</span> shoes,
uhh... a <span style="color: #f36;">*"hot red-pink"*</span> cold shoulder sweater <span style="color: #117f9a;">(doesn't rlly look like it)</span>,
<span style="color: #d9eee5; text-shadow: 0px 0px 3px #2f003e, 0px 0px 3px #2f003e;">white</span> socks,
<span style="color: #d9eee5; text-shadow: 0px 0px 3px #2f003e, 0px 0px 3px #2f003e;">white</span> shorts with a
<span style="color: #117f9a;">teal</span> stripe, and <span style="color: #117f9a;">teal/blue</span> eyes.

her appearance is meant to prsent her as a cozy, energetic, a bit laid-back, and loveable character. i hope it works.

<br/>
## extra notes
- the symbols in her eyes are not exactly optional, i have stuff to explain soon and i hope no one misses that. i've been working in this story for 4 years as of writing this. you will have an explanation soon.
    - a bit of an extra fact: the thingies are more apparent <span style="color: #f36;">(i.e. "get brighter")</span> in moments of stress or distress


- unlike the rest, she actually has <span style="color: #f36;">**alternative** designs</span>!! they're not meant to replace the base one tho, it's just designs that tell you more about the character
