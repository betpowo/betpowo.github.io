she is one lovely bunny. she's 20 and looking for jobs, but nothing works.
she doesn't care though she's still happy as ever! she's energetic sometimes, other time's
she's lazy, i don't know, i just know she has human feelings. she Loves her awesome partner
[jasmine](/characters/jasmine/) like nothing else (well, kinda like her family,
specially her mom, [haven](/characters/haven/))

she (platonically) loves all her other friends, and would NOT want to lose them anytime.
