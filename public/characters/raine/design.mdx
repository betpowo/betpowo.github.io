<span style="color: #6994f1;">(using different pronouns each time because why not)</span>

they have somewhat <span style="color: #303; text-shadow: 0px 0px 3px #ffc, 0px 0px 3px #ffc;">black</span>
spiky hair and <span style="color: #f19369;">whatever this color is</span> for skin, maybe
with tiny changes but idk i like the color

don't worry... they can see!!! idk how but i just know raine can see without visible pupils... some might even
find it scary... sad because raine finds it normal (it's had that since forever)

raine has a lot of stars in his design which i think is awesome, there's 2 on her face and 1 on its top.
not sure if the arm warmer stuff should be connected to their top i already have like 3 ocs with that
same exact thing it would feel very repetitive

his pants are also <span style="color: #303; text-shadow: 0px 0px 3px #ffc, 0px 0px 3px #ffc;">black</span>
and i think they would probably be bootcut??? probably not. they also have that cool grid pattern and... idk what
that <span style="color: #9fc;">green</span> chain thing is. really. idk what it is i just thought it looked cool...

oh yea, the <span style="color: #9fc;">green</span> and <span style="color: #fcf;">pink</span> pattern
on her hair. i think it's awesome too

in general, their design is pretty spiky but also a lil soft in nature which is cool!! that definitely defines
raine as a person i think
