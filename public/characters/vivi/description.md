vivi is just a regular high-school girl with mystical personality that carries an orb around. all the flipping time. she has a cat and puts both The orb and the cat in a backpack which i've never drawn

the orb means a lot to her, it belongs to her family that uh... she hasn't seen in a while.
the orb means good fortune and luck for them and she's trying to continue that legacy

*(i had to implement gradient color buttons JUST for this character. that's too many hair colors)*
