ok she has <span style="color: #3d3062;">black</span> hair, a zebra print shirt with
orange text that says "fuckign awesome", <span style="color: #3d3062;">black</span>
jeans and <span style="color: #636;">purple</span> shoes
her fit is tuff as fuck i know!
<br/>
## extra notes
- the text on her shirt is misspelled, this is on
purpose, you must draw her with that misspelling.
she was a design i <span style="color: #9366aa;">(aldi)</span> made when i <span style="color: #9366aa;">(aldi)</span> was like 11, she used to have a
white hoodie and she didn't have dreads.
- she lost her horn from falling down the stairs this one time, fucking
loser haha
- if you couldn't tell she's a demon! she was born this way. i <span style="color: #9366aa;">(aldi)</span> don't have an
explanation for that other than i <span style="color: #9366aa;">(aldi)</span> thought it was tuff as fuck.
she really likes tyler the creator, the shirt she's wearing is from some
outfit he wore this time!
