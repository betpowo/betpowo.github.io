similar to the original **boyfriend**:

he has his <span style="color: #2eaeac;">blue</span> hair and pronounce<br/>
and a <span style="color: #b20069;">red</span> cap, soles on his
<span style="color: #e7f7ff; text-shadow: 0px 0px 3px #4a004a, 0px 0px 3px #4a004a;">white</span> shoes,
a big <span style="color: #b20069;">red</span> Ø symbol on his
<span style="color: #e7f7ff; text-shadow: 0px 0px 3px #4a004a, 0px 0px 3px #4a004a;">white</span> shirt,
and <span style="color: #2eaeac;">blue</span> pants.

he's always having a menacing stare because he's kind of hyperactive and just wanna... idk.. sing for eternity
