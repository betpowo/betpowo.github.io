she has <span style="color: #553831;">brown</span> hair. it has seen better days...

she also has a <span style="color: #cc6699;">pink</span> headband cus she thinks it's cute,
she wears <span style="color: #cc6699;">pink</span> crocs, and 
<span style="color: #373E52;">black</span> pants and a <span style="color: #e9ffcc; text-shadow: 0px 0px 3px #3c102a, 0px 0px 3px #3c102a;">white</span>
top, both with floral/vine patterns on it. thought it would look cool

she tries her best to look young but it slightly fails due to the desaturated color scheme.
i think slight desaturation makes her look older

she also wears glasses! but circle ones this time
